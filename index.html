                The part I wanted to say is about the invisible impact of the
                scooter on our society and the pain of someone hidden behind
                convenience service. it is about the scooter's invisible shadow
                place part what we got to know. We thought the environmental
                problems of scooters were too easy to find and this shadow part
                is new problems we learned from further research. it is really
                interesting part for me. I wanted to communicate visually to
                help us understand the various stakeholders in society related
                to object that is not visible and I explained the stories of
                people in the shadow place that we learn.

              Shared electric scooter reduce loss by traffic jam, and enable
              efficient transportation. Their crucial service is highlighted by
              flexibility in pick-up, returning, and charging. Because they
              don’t have specified parking lot, users can leave them on streets
              after finding them with mobile applications. Transportation is no
              longer a belonging, but is rather becoming a concept of sharing.
              Electric scooters are very convenient and welcomed in that they
              have no troubles of loss or parking. electric scooters use battery
              for pick-up and drops without docking. They are charged by
              contract labors at night. These kind of charging communities are
              rapidly increasing with electric scooter service. We researched
              the shadow place of scooters and found that new social problems
              arise from the core services of scooters.

              Between 9pm and 7 am in the evening when service user is reduced,
              scooters are collected and recharged at each Juicer’s individual
              workplace, home, or office and place in the specified lime hub.
              Once a scooter is recovered, charged, or placed, the charger can
              earn between 2.5 euro to 4.5 euro per unit, depending on the
              amount of battery remaining and the location of the scooter to be
              collected. As platform based sharing economy such as Lime,
              economic activities based on sharing were activated and brought
              significant changes to the labor market such as break age of labor
              relations and expansion of platform workers. Reaching the ‘sharing
              economy’era, labor is being changed as a ‘voluntary’ and
